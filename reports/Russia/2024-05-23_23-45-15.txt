I never imagined my life would turn out like this. Growing up in Russia, I believed in the sanctity of family. Sergei and I married young, but over time, his charm turned to violence. The abuse started small but quickly escalated. Friends told me to be more obedient, and the police dismissed my cries for help, citing the 2017 decriminalization of certain domestic violence cases.

One night, Sergei's drunken rage left me with a broken arm and ribs. I fled to a shelter, where I found solace among other survivors. Here, we share our pain and begin to heal, but the fight for justice continues. Despite the fear and societal indifference, I dream of a day when women in Russia are truly protected and safe. For now, we take it one day at a time, refusing to be silent.
