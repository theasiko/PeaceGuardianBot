For years, I endured severe domestic violence from my partner. The abuse, which began soon after our wedding, included physical, psychological, economic, and sexual harm. Psychological abuse was the most damaging, leaving deep emotional scars.

Eventually, I sought help and found refuge in a shelter. With the support of local organizations and hotlines like 016, I began to rebuild my life. Today, I work to support other victims, offering legal and psychological assistance.
