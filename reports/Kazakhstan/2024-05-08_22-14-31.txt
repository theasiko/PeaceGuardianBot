The incident happened last night at our house. My husband attacked me and I was beaten until I lost consciousness. I have a lot of bruises, especially on my face and neck, and one of my ribs is broken. My husband started beating me with his fists and feet. My screams didn't stop him. During the attack, I felt fear and despair, and then I lost consciousness from pain and helplessness. I had to seek medical help and now I feel weak and traumatized. At the time of the incident, there were neighbors in the house who heard my screams and called the police. I have medical documents confirming the severity of my injuries.
